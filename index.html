<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the
1980s.[8] By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform
Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was
made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.[9]

While working at CERN, Berners-Lee became frustrated with the inefficiencies and difficulties posed by finding
information stored on different computers.[10] On March 12, 1989, he submitted a memorandum, titled "Information
Management: A Proposal",[11] to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced ENQUIRE, a database
and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate information
management system based on links embedded as text: "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated
with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document, you could skip to
them with a click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of
the word hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such
hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes
on to use the term hypermedia.[12]
